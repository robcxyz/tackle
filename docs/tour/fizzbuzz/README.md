# tackle fizzbuzz

If you are not familiar with [fizzbuzz](https://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest), it is one of the most basic / prolific programming interview questions with the following requirements:

- Write a function that takes an integer input
- Print `fizz` if divisible by 3
- Print `buzz` if divisible by 5
- Print the number if it is not divisible by either 3 or 5
- Thus for numbers like 15, we would print out `fizzbuzz`

Solving this problem many ways in tackle demonstrates some of tackle's flow control mechanisms.
