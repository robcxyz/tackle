- Split these up into individual tests
- Don't run everything through tackle - instead issolate into render 
- Things that wrap system modules (ie cwd) don't need assertions 
- Things that wrap platform modules should have some tests since they could throw depending on the platform - Should mock some of these?
- Tackle related vars should run through a tackle execution
